.. description: I have decided to explain to myself and to others what tags and categories mean on this website
.. type: text


You might be familiar with different systems for categorizing different things.
I might have a different way that and so this post is created to explain it.

.. TEASER_END

Main Categories:

Article - Mostly written content

Tags:

- Tech - How to interpret certain technologies, this is not necessarily only about programming. (hardware, wereables, integrating different tech)

- Programming - How to write code or my experience within that field which I wanted to share.

- Art - Different artistic endeavours of mine.

- Notes - Personal notes (such as experiences, ratings and more), will not be indexed.

- TODO - Personal TODO's with different ideas, will not be indexed.

- Python

- Esport

- Video

Some are self explanatory so I will not include description for them at this point in time.

My idea for this website was heavily influenced by what I've seen on https://beepb00p.xyz/
